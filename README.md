# graveyard-pics
Halloween themed game-tile images created by me, for use in banqui and other tile games
______
The images are pixel art of various Halloween creatures, plus some graveyard imagery. Each creature is set on four backgrounds, ranging from a night sky to shaded grass. When pieced together, the effect is of various creatures standing in a graveyard, with tombstones and dug up plots.

Here are each of the creatures, on various backgrounds:
