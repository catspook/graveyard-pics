The images are pixel art of various Halloween creatures, plus some graveyard imagery. Each creature is set on four backgrounds, ranging from a night sky to shaded grass. When pieced together, the effect is of various creatures standing in a graveyard, with tombstones and dug up plots. Check out [my wife's Halloween banqui game](https://github.coom/thea-leake/graveyard) for an example use case.

Here are each of the creatures, on the four types of background:
